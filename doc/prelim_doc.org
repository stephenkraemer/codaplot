* Dendrogram plotting
** current top level functions / classes
*** cut_dendrogram
- this is a thin wrapper around class CutDendrogram
- this function is used in cross_plot
- it can plot
  - standard dendrograms
  - cut dendrograms (cut above 'cluster level')
  - dendrograms with colored links (colors starting at 'cluster level')
- links can be colored for spaced and standard dendrograms, if cluster_ids_data_order is not None

* Heatmaps

- different heatmap functions co-exist in this module
- only one heatmap function should be used: heatmap
  - both for categorical and numeric heatmaps
  - both for dense and spaced heatmaps
  - heatmap internally calls heatmap2 and spaced_heatmap2. these functions should
    not be public and should not be used directly.

* Cross plot
** Dendrogram handling

- default dendrogram function: cut_dendrogram
- the dendrogram has colored links if cluster_ids_data_order is not None
  - this can be controlled explicitely by passing a dict to {row,col}_dendrogram setting this arg
  - it is controlled implicitely by cross_plot as follows
    - if we plot a spaced heatmap: cluster_ids_data_order =spacer_ids (?), else =None
